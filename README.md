### [Regression](https://github.com/dataismyname/data_science_python_projects/blob/main/Regression.ipynb)

I have explored both classical regression techniques and the cutting-edge realm of neural networks. These projects involve the utilization of data from garments workers and focus on predictive modeling. The primary goal is to establish relationships between variables and predict the productivity of the workers.

### [Classification](https://github.com/dataismyname/data_science_python_projects/blob/main/Classification.ipynb)

My work in this category encompasses both traditional classification algorithms and the powerful capabilities of neural networks. Classification projects involve the task of categorizing data into predefined classes. In this specific case, the data used consists of information about individuals in a database, categorized based on various criteria, including demographic aspects and other additional attributes. Additionally, there is a 'Segmentation' column that has been chosen as the classes for classification.

### [Clustering](https://github.com/dataismyname/data_science_python_projects/blob/main/Clustering_covid19.ipynb)

I've undertaken the intricate task of grouping data using multiple clustering methods. By employing algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and more, I've unearthed hidden patterns and structures within datasets, yielding insightful revelations and guiding data-driven decisions. In this specific case, I utilized two datasets for cross-analysis, aiming to leverage their intersecting information. One dataset contains registered COVID-19 cases, providing information by date and country, while the other dataset offers data about the density of medical doctors by country and year.
The primary objective was to ascertain whether any relationships exist between the provided information that would facilitate grouping based on existing attributes.

Through these projects, I've gained valuable experience in implementing machine learning models, preprocessing data, feature engineering, and evaluating model performance. Each project has provided a unique opportunity to apply different techniques to real-world scenarios, enhancing my skills and deepening my understanding of the field.
